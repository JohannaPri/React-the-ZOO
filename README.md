## üìÑ About The Project 

**During the "Advanced JavaScript" course at Medieinstitutet, we were assigned the task of developing a website for The Zoo using React and TypeScript.**

The project required us to create an interactive and responsive webpage that not only displayed information about different animals but also offered users a seamless and engaging experience.
